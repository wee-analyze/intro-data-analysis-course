Udacity's Data Analysis Intro Course

Programming Language: Python 2.7

This is my Jupyter Notebook for Udacity's Intro to Data Analysis course which I took a long time ago when I was learning
how to use Python. The course analyzed 3 csv files that contained information about Udacity students (daily engagement, project submissions, and enrollments).
